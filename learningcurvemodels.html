<h1>Learning Curve Models</h1><br><br>
<h1>1.Diminishing-Returns Learning Curve</h1>
<img src="https://www.valamis.com/documents/10197/520324/diminishing-returns-lc.png" alt="">
<p>The rate of progression increases rapidly at the beginning and then decreases over time.<br><br>
This describes a situation where the task may be easy to learn and progression of learning is initially fast and rapid.</p>
<h1>2.Increasing-Returns Learning Curve</h1>
<img src="https://www.valamis.com/documents/10197/520324/increasing-returns-lc.png" alt="image" >
<p>The rate of progression is slow at the beginning and then rises over time until full proficiency is obtained.<br><br>
This model describes a situation where perhaps a complex task is being learned and the rate of learning is initially slow.</p>
<h1>3.Increasing-Decreasing Return Learning Curve(the S-curve)</h1>
<img src="https://www.valamis.com/documents/10197/520324/s-curve-lc.png" alt="image">
<p>This model is the most commonly cited learning curve and is known as the “S-curve” model.<br><br>
It measures an individual who is new to a task. The bottom of the curve indicates slow learning as the learner works to master the skills required and takes more time to do so.<br>
The latter half of the curve indicates that the learner now takes less time to complete the task as they have become proficient in the skills required. Often the end of the curve begins to level off, indicating a plateau or new challenges.</p>
<h1>4.Complex Learning Curve</h1>
<img src="https://www.valamis.com/documents/10197/520324/complex-lc.png" alt="image">
<p>This model represents a more complex pattern of learning and reflects more extensive tracking.<br><br>

1.The beginning of the curve indicates that learning is initially slow.<br><br>
2.The second stage of the curve shows an increase, which indicates that the learner is becoming proficient in the skill.<br><br>
3.The third stage of the curve indicates that the learner is plateauing in his proficiency once the learner feels he has mastered the skill.<br><br>
4.The fourth stage of the curve represents that the learner is actually still improving the skill.<br><br>
5.The last stage of the curve represents the point at which the skill becomes automatic, muscle memory for the learner, often termed “over learning”.</p>
