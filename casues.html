<h1>What Casues Of Exam Fear?</h1>

<h1>Physical and Emotional Pressure</h1>
<p>Stress may be considered as any physical, chemical, or emotional factor. The physical and chemical factors develop sickness, injury, trauma, etc. Whereas, the emotional stress deals with stress and tension. The students show various signs that can relate to examination stress such as Headache, Insomnia, Loss of appetite, loss of concentration, Panic attacks, Self-harming behaviour and Depression.</p>
<h1>External Pressure</h1>

<p>Many students feel pressured due to expectations from family members or teachers. Parents expect their children to score high marks in the exam. This pressure to do well increases the stress among students.</p>
<h1>Internal Pressure</h1>

<p>Sometimes the pressure is not built by family or teachers instead, developed within the students. If the students want to score well in exams then poor performance can be a fear for them. This can lead to anxiety and tension</p>
<h1>Lack of Preparation</h1>
<p>Sometimes students are not prepared well for the exams which can lead to stress. They should study in advance and not wait for the last moment, rushing at the  last minute can cause anxiety. Lack of time management, poor study planning, not clearing doubts with teachers or friends, referring outdated study material can lead to anxiety and pressure. Lack of proper sleep can also be a reason for the stress.</p>
<h1>Lifestyle</h1>
<p style="float:>Students sometimes fail to follow a healthy routine in their lifestyle. You must understand how much it can affect the mental and physical health of students. This includes include inadequate rest, poor nutrition, irregular exercise, time management problems etc. </p>
<h1>Poor Studying Habits</h1>

<p>It is important for the student to keep updated with the study material before exams. And gather information for the missed classes or sessions. Also the way they study also matters. For example, if the student has inconsistent content coverage, trying to memorize the textbooks or studying the whole night just before the exam is an inefficient way of studying style. Whereas students who study without understanding or not revising are ineffective ways of studying.</p>
