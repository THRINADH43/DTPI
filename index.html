The learning curve theory proposes that a learner’s efficiency in a task improves over time the more the learner performs the task.</p><br>

   padding-left: 80px;">Theory of Learning curve</h1>
<p style="color:black;font-size:160%;text-align:justify;padding-right: 90px;padding-left: 80px">While the term "learning curve" came into use in the early 20th century, <i>Dr. Hermann Ebbinghaus</i> described this theory as early as 1885.<br><br>

He mostly was focusing on memory studies and developed a forgetting curve theory. This theory helps us to understand how our memory works, and retains information, relating to specific things people attempt to learn.<br><br>
The modern Microlearning theory is based on Ebbinghaus memory studies. Nowadays it helps us understand when and why we forget certain information and how we can tackle this.<br><br>
Later, <i>Arthur Bills</i> described the learning curve in his work “General experimental psychology” (Bills, Arthur Gilbert, in 1934, page 192).<br><br>

In his work, he describes it saying, “the learning curve is a graphical device for picturing the rate of improvement in terms of a given criterion of efficiency, as a result of practice.”<br><br>

He described two sides of the same process and had presented two learning curve graphs.</p><br><br>
<h2 style="text-align:centre;">The 1st curve of achievement represents an increase in productivity over each unit of trial.</h2>

<br><h2>The 2nd illustrates an eliminative, or declining, curve of time needed to perform the same task.</br>

<h1>Learning cuvre Formula </h2><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>The original model uses the formula:Y=aX<sup>b</b></p><br><br>
<p>Where:<br>
Y is the average time over the measured duration<br>
a represents the time to complete the task the first time<br>
X represents the total amount of attempts completed<br>
b represents the slope of the function<br><br>
*The formula can be used as a prediction tool to forecast to future performance</p>

<h1>How to Improve Learning Curve</h1><br><br>
<h3>1.Start with your Strengths</h3>
<p>When you’re starting out with a new process, it is best to go ahead with tasks that you are already well-aware of. This will help you get the hang of the process before you move on to tougher tasks. Starting with your strengths will also keep your motivation high.</p><Br>
<br><h3>2.Don't Except Miracles</h3>
<br><p>In the process of improving your learning curve, you will have to put in a lot of time. It is not a magic trick that will make you a pro within a few days.</p>
<br><h3>3.repeat and Redo</h3>
<br><p>The learning curve theory is all about repeating the job at hand to reduce the total amount of time it takes.<br>
Hence, the ultimate goal is to fit in as many repetitions as possible for a specific task. It gets boring and redundant, but without redoing the same thing over and over, your learning curve will not get any better.</p>
<br><h3>4.Use the Right Techniques</h3>
<br><p>Everyone has a different way of learning. However, he generalized learning techniques have come into existence after a lot of trial and error.<br>
You may be tempted to try out new methods of learning for yourself, but in the process of improving your learning curve, time is of immense importance. This is why you should stick to the tried and true techniques of learning whatever task you’re working on.</p><br>
<br><h3>5.Take it one step at a time</h3>
<br><p style="float:right;" ><img style="float:left;width:300px;height:300px" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS20C8OGe-s5FtJqLHg3VFk-6hGzNKPheqDjw&usqp=CAU" alt="image" >The learning curve varies for different tasks and skills. Therefore, only tackle one learning curve at a time<br>
For example, f you’re working on a musical skill, stick to it until you master it. Then, move forward to something new. You will only make things more time-consuming and difficult if you attempt to tackle multiple skills and tasks simultaneously.<br>
Approaching various tasks at the same time will not be effective at all. Instead, it will do the complete opposite and further slow you down.<br>
Also, within one skill, divide the learning into chunks. Do not try to take on all the possible information at once.</p><br>
<br><h3>6.Evaluate Yourself</h3>
<br><p>Imagine doing all the hard work but not noticing any learning progress in the end. To keep this devastating misfortune from happening, keep evaluating yourself regularly. It can be done weekly or bi-weekly as per the nature of what you’re practicing.<br>
Your personal evaluations should be honest. One way to measure your progress is to time yourself. It will be a foolproof representation of your advancement.<br>
If you’re not improving at a steady pace, you probably need to change your learning techniques. The fault may be in your schedule. You could be putting too much pressure on yourself or not working hard enough.</p><br>
<br><h3>7.Stay Focused</h3>
<br><p>The entire technique of using the learning curve is dependent on your brain. If the brain isn’t focused, all your efforts will be useless.<br>
To stay focused, you will have to work extremely hard. The hard work of a few days will help you out for the rest of your life. Alongside that, you cannot afford to waste time. Focus on the practical skills that will help you in life.<br>
All of these factors combined will lead to positive results. You can set out time in your schedule for mental exercises to strengthen your focus. Another thing to do is to practice your skill in isolation so that there are minimal distractions. Breaks are yet another vital part of maintaining your focus throughout the process.</p><br>
<br><h3>8.Stay Determined</h3>
<br><p>You know how charcoal has to go through indescribable pressure to become a diamond? Well, you’ll have to go through something similar, too. As said previously, it is not a magic trick.<br>
You can only be successful if you stay determined. If you head in intending to quit as things get difficult to manage, you’ll never reach your goal.</p><br>
